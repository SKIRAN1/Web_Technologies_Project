                    Gum disease is the inflammation or infection that attacks the gums and bone that hold your teeth in place.
                    Gum disease can be treated in ways ranging from cleaning to surgery but it can be prevented altogether by regular brushing, flossing and professional cleaning.
                    Various periodontal treatments include Scaling, Deep Cleaning, Root Planing, Flap surgery,Bone and Soft Tissue Grafting (Regeneration).
                    Lasers are frequently used in treating gum diseases.

                    Baby teeth set the foundation for healthy permanent teeth. It is important to keep the 
                    teeth clean and teach children to brush and floss.
                    Dental visits have to be early and frequent to monitor the development of the teeth. The
                    baby teeth serve as placeholders for the permanent teeth. Sealants are a thin coating 
                    placed on the biting surfaces of the back teeth to prevent cavities. 
                    Routine professional cleaning and fluoride treatment are essential to ensure a life time 
                    of healthy teeth.

                <p>
                    When there are several problems in a single case, a team of specialists work together 
                    to restore the function and appearance of the teeth. This full mouth rehabilitation is
                    highly successful with our careful planning and treatment sequencing. The cosmetic
                    dentist works along with the periodontists, orthodontists and maxillofacial surgeon 
                    to provide a stunning SMILE MAKEOVER.

                <p>
                    Titanium implants serve as the artificial root in the jaw to support crowns and dentures. 
                    When teeth are missing in the jaw, fixed artificial teeth can be provided by inserting
                    titanium implants which serve as the tooth or foundation for the teeth. These implants
                    provide a very stable support to help restore function and appearance. The implants are
                    placed in the clinic under local anaesthetic and after a period of healing the artificial 
                    teeth are fabricated. Implants are used in combinations with bridges, dentures or crowns
                    to replace any number of missing teeth.

                <p>
                    Orthodontics refers to the use of wires to align crooked or crowded teeth and to close
                    gaps between teeth. Though Orthodontics can be started at any age, it is strongly 
                    advised to bring your child for a checkup anytime after 6 years of age, since many 
                    adult dental problems can be avoided by early orthodontics. Adults can also have their 
                    teeth straightened as orthodontics is not limited to children.
